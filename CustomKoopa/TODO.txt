TODO List.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

v1.00 stuff

-Clean Up Code
--There's a lot of weird decisions during the timerush on Winter C3 2022
--Also need to make the code formatting more consistent
--This includes macros, which don't currently use variable arguments

-Comment Code Properly
--This will be done after the code is cleaned up

-Allow user to define various properties separately
--Currently, a lot of things are hardcoded, in part due to the rush

-Find a User-Friendly way of handling Graphics stuff
--As it is currently, it's not very clear to the user
--Pointers and Tilemaps definitely need a facelift

-Proper SA-1 Testing
--Self-explanatory

-Freeform version of Custom Koopa
--This will be a bit more flexible than the "Traditional" Custom Koopa
--This will start once the "Traditional" version is finalized
